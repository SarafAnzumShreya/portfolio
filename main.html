                <p>I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET). As a kid, I always wanted to be an Engineer. I keep interest in computer science and software. They find joy in exploring the intricacies of coding, learning new programming languages, and experimenting with different software applications. <br><br>

                I also do some graphic designing and sell my designs on a online platform called Redbubble.</p><br>

                <p>
                    Reverse vending machine (RVM) is an innovative solution in waste management and sustainability. Reverse vending machines are automated systems designed to accept used beverage containers, such as plastic bottles and provide incentives or rewards to users in return. This project explores the integration of machine learning technology into Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) as a cutting-edge solution for enhancing waste management. The primary focus is on automating the recognition and collection process of used beverage containers, specifically plastic bottles, within RVMs while providing users with incentives or rewards. Additionally, the project emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between automated recycling and user engagement, with incentives or rewards acting as catalysts for increased participation.<br> Some of the basic operations of a reverse vending machine are-

                    <b>Bottle Recognition:</b>
                    The machine uses advanced technology, 
                    such as machine learning algorithms, to identify beverage container, primarily focusing on plastic bottles.<br><br>
 
                    <b>Deposit Mechanism:</b>
                    The machine is equipped with a secure deposit area where users
                    place their used beverage containers. This area ensures proper handling and containment.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>QR Code scanning:</b>
                    Upon depositing plastic bottle, a QR code containing users account ID is scanned for providing reward.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Rewarding:</b>Upon scanning the QR code, a certain amount of credit with added to their account which can later be redeemed as usable currency.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Bin Full Sensing:</b>
                    When the container or the bin is full, a message is shown alerting about the condition.<br><br>
